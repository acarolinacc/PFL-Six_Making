## Description
Six Making is a board game in which players must stack a total of 6 pieces, with their own on top, to win the game.
The game is played on a 5x5 board, with each player owning 16 pieces; in each player's turn, they may either place one of their pieces on any empty space on the board, or move one of their pieces or towers on top of another.
The height of a tower also dictates its movement rules:
- 1 piece (Pawn)	: moves 1 space in all 4 orthogonal directions;
- 2 pieces (Rook)	: moves any number of spaces in one of the 4 orthogonal directions;
- 3 pieces (Knight) : moves in an L-shape (2 spaces then 1 space laterally);
- 4 pieces (Bishop)	: moves any number of spaces in one of the 4 diagonal directions;
- 5 pieces (Queen)	: moves any number of spaces in all 8 directions.
A player may play a tower as long as one of its pieces belongs to them; furthermore, a player may split a tower by taking a certain number of pieces from the top and playing it in the same way the original tower would be played.
Finally, a player may not make a move that leads to the same situation from 2 turns ago.
